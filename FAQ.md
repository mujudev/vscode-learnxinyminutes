# FAQ

## Framework-specific files not opening the associated language's cheat?
In the case of framework files (e.g. vue, tsx, etc.), you can manually set the cheatsheet association by using the "**Set File Association**" command. The VS Code window will need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect.

## Can't find a cheatsheet for your language or tool?
The creation and moderation of these cheatsheets is a community effort. Once you get up to speed on whatever subject you were looking for, consider contributing a cheatsheet to the [learnxinyminutes-docs](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs) repository.

## Having an issue with the extension itself?
Submit an [issue](https://github.com/mujundi/vscode-learnxinyminutes/issues) on GitHub, or if you find an issue and know the solution, feel free to fork this repo and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/mujundi/vscode-learnxinyminutes/pulls). The same goes for feature requests!
