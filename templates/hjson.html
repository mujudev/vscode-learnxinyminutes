<h1>Hjson</h1>
<p>Hjson is an attempt to make <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/json/" rel="nofollow">JSON</a> more human readable.</p>
<p>Hjson is a syntax extension to JSON.<br>
It's NOT a proposal to replace JSON or to incorporate it into the JSON spec itself.<br>
It's intended to be used like a user interface for humans,<br>
to read and edit before passing the JSON data to the machine.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at examples to see the key syntax differences!</p>

        I wish JSON was more human readable.
        If only there was a JSON for my needs!
        Oh wait.. there is! It's called Hjson.

    example1: "If, you're, going, to, comma in a string, use, quotes!"
    example2: "Also if you want to use {} or [] or any JSON relevant punctuation!"
    example3: [because, this, is, totally, BROKEN!]
    example4: this is technically OK though: {}[],:
