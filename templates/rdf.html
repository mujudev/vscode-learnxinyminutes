<h1>RDF</h1>
<p>RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/" rel="nofollow">W3C<br>
standard</a> data<br>
model. The W3C has standardized several RDF syntaxes; examples below use the<br>
most popular one, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/" rel="nofollow">Turtle</a>.</p>
<p>One nice advantage of Turtle files is that if you concatenate any two<br>
syntactically valid Turtle files, you will have another syntactically valid<br>
Turtle file. This is one of many things about RDF that ease data integration.</p>
<p>The W3C standard query language for RDF datasets is<br>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/" rel="nofollow">SPARQL</a>.</p>
<p>RDF expresses all facts as three-part {subject, predicate, object} statements<br>
known as triples. Because the same entity can be the subject of some triples<br>
and the object of others, a set of triples can represent a graph data<br>
structure. A large-scale storage system for triples is called a triplestore,<br>
and falls into the graph database category of NoSQL databases.</p>
<p>RDF subjects and predicates must be URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), which<br>
usually look like URLs but function as identifiers, not locators. The use of<br>
URIs provides context for resource identifiers to make them unambiguous—for<br>
example, to tell a book title from a job title.</p>

# Turtle triple statements end with periods like natural language sentences.

# These two triples tell us that the mythical Example Company's
# employee 134 has a hire date of 2022-11-12 and a family name of Smith:

&lt;http://example.com/emp134&gt; &lt;http://example.com/hireDate&gt; "2022-11-12" .
&lt;http://example.com/emp134&gt; &lt;http://example.com/familyName&gt; "Smith" .

# Declaring prefixes to stand in for namespaces reduces verbosity. These
# declarations typically go at the beginning of the file, but the only
# requirement is that they come before the first use of the prefix they declare.

@prefix ex: &lt;http://example.com/&gt; .
ex:emp134 ex:hireDate "2022-11-12" .
ex:emp134 ex:familyName "Smith" .

# A semicolon means that the next triple uses the same subject as the last
# one. This is handy for listing data about a single resource. The following
# example means the same thing as the previous one.

@prefix ex: &lt;http://example.com/&gt; .
ex:emp134 ex:hireDate "2022-11-12" ;
          ex:familyName "Smith" .

# A comma means that the next triple has the same subject and predicate as
# the previous one.

ex:emp134 ex:nickname "Smithy", "Skipper", "Big J". 

# Three single or double quote marks at the beginning and end of a value let
# you define a  multi-line string value.

ex:emp134 ex:description """
Skipper joined the company in November. 

He always has a joke for everyone.""" . 

# Using URIs from existing standard vocabulary namespaces eases both data
# integration and interoperability with the large amount of RDF that already
# exists. Mixing and matching of standard and local custom namespaces is
# common.

@prefix vcard: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#&gt; .
ex:emp134 ex:hireDate "2022-11-12" ;
          vcard:family-name "Smith" .

# Related RDF standards provide vocabularies that are popular for basic
# facts. The rdfs:label predicate from the RDF Schema standard is a common 
# way to indicate a human-readable name.

@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .
ex:hireDate rdfs:label "hire date" . 

# String object values can include language codes, making
# multi-lingual representation of entities easier for applications
# reading the data (for example, when generating a user interface).

ex:hireDate rdfs:label "hire date"@en, "date d'embauche"@fr  . 

# Representing a triple's object with a URI (or prefixed name) is not required
# but lets you connect up triples into a graph.

ex:emp134 vcard:family-name "Smith" .
ex:emp113 vcard:family-name "Jones" ;
          ex:reportsTo ex:emp134 . 

# Objects can be datatypes from the XML Schema part 2 standard or your own
# custom datatypes.

@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .
ex:emp134 vcard:family-name "Smith"^^xsd:string ;  # default data type
          ex:hireDate "2022-11-12"^^xsd:date ;
          ex:rating "3.5"^^ex:someCustomType . 

# The use of schemas with RDF is optional. Schemas may describe all or a
# subset of a dataset. They use a vocabulary described by the W3C RDF Schema
# (RDFS) standard, usually with a prefix of rdfs.

# These schemas are descriptive, to ease the accommodation of new
# datasets, not proscriptive rules about how new data should be 
# created. The following declares a class. (Note that RDFS is itself 
# expressed in triples.)

@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; . 
ex:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .

# The following triple means the same as the preceding one but 
# uses a Turtle shortcut for terseness and more readability.

ex:Person a rdfs:Class .

# That last triple declares that ex:Person is an instance of a class, and the
# following declares that employee 113 is an instance of the class Employee.

ex:emp113 a ex:Employee . 

# The first triple below is actually unnecessary because a typical
# RDFS processor will infer from the second one that ex:Employee is a
# class. (Only a subset of RDF parsers perform RDFS inferencing.)

ex:Employee a rdfs:Class .
ex:Employee rdfs:subClassOf ex:Person .

# An RDF parser that reads the last four triples shown and understands
# RDFS will infer that ex:emp113 is an instance of ex:Person, because
# it's an instance of ex:Employee, a subclass of ex:Person.

# RDFS lets you declare properties and associate them with classes. 
# Properties are first class resources and don't "belong" to classes 
# in the object-oriented sense. rdfs:domain means "the following object 
# class uses the property named by this triple's subject". rdfs:range 
# means "the property named by this triple's subject will have a value of 
# the following class or type". 

ex:birthday rdf:type rdf:Property ; 
            rdfs:domain ex:Person ;
            rdfs:range xsd:date .
