<h2>Framework-specific files not opening the associated language's cheat?</h2>
<p>In the case of framework files (e.g. vue, tsx, etc.), you can manually set the cheatsheet association by using the "<strong>Set File Association</strong>" command. The VS Code window will need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect.</p>
<h2>Can't find an appropriate cheatsheet for your language or tool?</h2>
<p>The creation and moderation of these cheatsheets is a community effort. Once you get up to speed on whatever subject you were looking for, consider contributing a cheatsheet to the <a href="https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs">learnxinyminutes-docs</a> repository.</p>
