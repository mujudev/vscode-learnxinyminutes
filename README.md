# learnxinyminutes (VS Code Extension)

This extension uses the materials from [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), a site with cheatsheets that can get you quickly up and running in an unfamiliar language. Instead of having to navigate to a browser, the cheatsheets can now be opened directly within VS Code.

The open source repository behind the cheatsheets on [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) can be found at [learnxinyminutes-docs](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs). As cheatsheets get added and improved, they will be ported into this extension!
